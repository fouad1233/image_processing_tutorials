# Project 1

> **Note:** I start to write an image analyzing tool library for all the projects. I named the library image image_analyzer.py and it include the main class `Image_analyzer()` . This class includes at this moment certain functions that can help in the project and is usefull, like read and write pgm files and drawing lines.

> I will use this library functions in all my assignments in this course and i will extend this library project by project with a purpose to understanding making usefull libraries for image processing and make libraries that can be easly reused by other peoples and engineers.
